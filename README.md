# pyMMSmap

pyMMSmap (Python MMS Map) generates maps from NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale datasets. Used in https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021JA029389.

Currently supported are Solitary Wave Detector DSP algorithm (SWD) and the Fast Plasma Investigations (FPI).

This is released under something like the CRAPL (https://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/) with the goal of improving MMS data accessibility :)
